# PART 1

The imaging technique that I found inspiring is the album cover of the **Currents**
*album by Tame Impala* who is an australian musician. This composition features a 
psychedelic design with vibrant colours, it has smooth lines that are a shade 
of purple with the black canvas for the background, there are purple, red and 
yellow lines which are interrupted by the metallic sphere, which represent a collision between chaos and order, echoing themes of disruption and transformation
The colour palette creates a sense of movement

The smooth, wavy lines evoke a sense of flow and rhythm, much like the sonic landscape of the album itself


## This design inspires projects focused on 
- visualizing flow
 - disruption
 - movement.

PART 1

The imaging technique that I found inspiring is the album cover of the Currents
album by Tame Impala who is an australian musician. This composition features a 
psychedelic design with vibrant colours, it has smooth lines that are a shade 
of purple with the black canvas for the background, there are purple, red and 
yellow lines which are interferred by a metallic sphere which creates distortion
around the lines. This design inspires projects focused on visualizing flow, disruption, and movement.
